Getting Started with creating a React App with vite
This project was bootstrapped with Vite.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm run dev
It runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
